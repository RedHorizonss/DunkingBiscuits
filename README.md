# Exploring the Pore Radius for Each Biscuit Through Histograms

The file "washburn_model" tests different models in comparison to the washburn equation for biscuits.

The file "N-modal_interactive" presents an two widgets where you can adjust the bandwidth of a KDE, the tolerance the peaks are found at and the biscuit type.

Wdiget 1 presents the KDE plot and plots the peaks found in each KDE. Widget 2 presents the evolution of these peaks and highlights which ones are found at the set maximum bandwisth. The tolerance for each plot shows less peaks the higher the tolerance value is set to.

Lastly file "N-modal_results" presents the qnatifies results of setting the number of modes we want to find within a distribution and collecting values that are similar to this modal value. To allows us to present the mode average pore radius for each biscuit type, and what those values mean for the amount of tea a biscuit can soak up.
